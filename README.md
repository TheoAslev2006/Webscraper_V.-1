My first Python project.
I will keep updating it until its completed and if you for some reason stumble uppon this program and find some bugs pls tell me so i can make it better.
The program is a webscraper that finds specific things in html code from a website (if the website allows it of course) and it comes with some url you can test it on 
(youtube and bbc included)
